- Replace loading the font in dynamically with embedding it
  in your application using some sort of generator.
  You can #include some file that does something like

char generated_font[] = {
	0xFF, 0x0f, ...
	0xFF, 0x0f, ...
	0xFF, 0x0f, ...
	0xFF, 0x0f, ...
	0xFF, 0x0f, ...
	0xFF, 0x0f, ...
};
int generated_font_w = [filled];
inr generated_font_h = [filled];
